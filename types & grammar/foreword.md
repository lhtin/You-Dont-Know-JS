# You Don't Know JS: Types & Grammar
# Foreword

It was once said, "JavaScript is the only language developers don't learn to use before using it."

I laugh each time I hear that quote because it was true for me and I suspect it was for many other developers. JavaScript, and maybe even CSS and HTML, were not a core computer science language taught at college in the Internet's early days, so personal development was very much based on the budding developer's search and "view source" abilities to __piece together__(整合...来搞事情) these basic web languages.

I still remember my first high school website project. The task was to create any type of web store, and me being a James Bond fan, I decided to create a Goldeneye store. It had everything: the Goldeneye midi theme song playing in the background, a JavaScript-powered crosshairs following the mouse around the screen, and a gunshot sound that played upon every click. Q would have been proud of this masterpiece of a website.

I tell that story because I did back then what many developers are doing today: I copied and pasted chunks of JavaScript code into my project without having a clue what's actually happening. The widespread use of JavaScript toolkits like jQuery have, in their own small way, __perpetuated__(让...一直存在) this pattern of nonlearning of core JavaScript.

I'm not __disparaging__(不重要) JavaScript toolkit use; after all, I'm a member of the MooTools JavaScript team! But the reason JavaScript toolkits are as powerful as they are is because their developers know the fundamentals, and their "gotchas," and apply them __magnificently__(优雅地). As useful as these toolkits are, it's still incredibly important to know the basics of the language, and with books like Kyle Simpson's *You Don't Know JS* series, there's no excuse not to learn them.

*Types and Grammar*, the third __installment__(part) of the series, is an excellent look at the core JavaScript fundamentals that copy and paste and JavaScript toolkits don't and could never teach you. Coercion and its __pitfalls__(难点), natives as constructors, and the whole __gamut__(广度) of JavaScript basics are thoroughly explained with focused code examples. Like the other books in this series, Kyle cuts straight to the point: __no fluff__(?!) and __word-smithing__(clever at using language) -- exactly the type of tech book I love.

Enjoy Types and Grammar and don't let it get too far away from your desk!
